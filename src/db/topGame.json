  "plot": "2003 In response to the increasing use of the latest digital encryption techniques to hide potential threats to the national security of the United States, the NSA (National Security Administration) was forced to start new developments in the field of intelligence gathering. This top-secret undertaking, dubbed Third Echelon, was the point of return to classic espionage techniques, enhanced by advanced surveillance and combat technology and aimed at aggressively collecting data stored in hostile territory. When information deemed vital to national security cannot be obtained through traditional means, Third Echelon is given the right to conduct physical operations. Despite US government denials, Third Echelon deployed units that became known as Splinter Cells: elite intelligence-gathering teams consisting of a single field agent backed by a remote team. These groups are compact, highly maneuverable and almost elusive. In 2004, the CIA contacted the NSA regarding the loss of contact with CIA agent Ellis Madison, who was tracking communications in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. A second agent, Blostein, was sent to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, in search of Agent Madison, but after seven days he did not get in touch. Fearing that American agents were in the hands of a suspected terrorist group, Third Echelon brought Splinter Cell operative Sam Fisher into the case to find the missing agents and resolve the situation.  You are Sam Fisher. You must not leave footprints on the physical or political map. Remember that while killing can compromise a cover, there is no choice at all between leaving a witness or a dead body. You don't exist. You are Splinter Cell.",
  "details": "The stealth-oriented gameplay of Splinter Cell, despite frequent comparisons to the Metal Gear series, actually bears more resemblance to the classic Thief stealth series. Controlling Sam, the player must skillfully hide in the shadows, sneak past the guards, use the environment and equipment. The shadow is the main assistant of the player. A special indicator is installed on the interface, indicating how visible Fisher is at a given time. This indicator allows the player to choose the right place in order to hide from enemies and not be seen. The use of weapons is not welcomed by the game - the sound of the shot is very loud and can be heard at a great distance, in addition, to immediately kill the enemy, you need to shoot in the head, which is not an easy task. Also, the player is given a small amount of ammo per level, which must be saved in case of emergency. For combat, Fisher has a silenced machine gun that can use various types of ammunition (from ordinary bullets to shock bullets), a silenced pistol, several types of grenades and various things. In addition to using weapons, Sam can incapacitate an enemy by stunning them with a blow to the neck. Sam can carry away all the bodies and hide them in the shadows so that other guards do not find them. Sometimes the conditions of the task make it impossible to kill enemies and force them to only stun or put them to sleep. If Fisher is still found, then the guards raise the alarm. After one or more alerts are raised, the game ends. Fisher can use his acrobatic skills and equipment to complete tasks. Sam can climb ledges, climb pipes, hang between two walls if necessary, etc. But not all tasks can be solved only with acrobatics. Fisher's inventory always includes trifocal night vision and infrared thermal goggles, lock picks to open locked doors, and an optical cable to peek under a door. The game is quite linear and offers several solutions. The player must simply figure out how to get from one point to the next in the most efficient way.",

  "plot": "Fallout 4 takes place in the 23rd century, two hundred years after the 2077 nuclear war. The world of the game is expressed retrofuturistic, i.e. visions of the future in the 1950s. The game world defends a region, Boston, Massachusetts, and other parts of New Zealand called the Massachusetts Wasteland. Unlike the empty spaces of other states, good conditions are observed there, although on the territory of places where radiation is contaminated. Due to the fact that many scientists lived in Boston, the state not only did not lose a lot of pre-war technologies, but also developed new ones, such as androids and teleporters, with the Institute's own forces. The story of Fallout 4 begins on the day of the nuclear bombing on October 23, 2077. The player character (Nate or Nora) initially lives with his wife/husband and son Sean in his home, refusing to listen to calls from the authorities to enroll in Vault-Tec's war vaults. When the war starts, the hero seeks salvation with his family in Vault 111. The platform with refugees manages to go underground, where Vault-Tec employees trick people into going into cryochambers. After some time, the character unfreezes and sees strangers from his cell who shoot his wife/husband and take away his son, after which he again plunges into suspended animation. Some time passes and the Vault 111 computer initiates an emergency shutdown of the cryochambers. The hero is selected and explores the Vault. On personal computers, he can learn that Vault-Tec ordered the personnel to stay underground for a year, but when the allotted time passed, no instructions were received. Eventually, the staff mutinied and left the Vault, leaving the refugees in suspended animation. The swarm finds an elevator and ascends to the surface, where they encounter a robotic butler who informs them that 210 years have passed since the bombing. Taking the name Last Man Standing, the player character decides to explore the world and discover the fate of his son.",
  "details" : "Fallout 4 is an action/RPG game where you can switch between first and third person. The basic principles remain the same as in previous games: explore the world, fighting against enemies that come across on the way, complete the tasks of different characters for the sake of their own development and advancement of the plot. Before starting the game, you can customize the appearance of the protagonist by choosing gender, skin color, facial features. For the first time in the history of the series, the main character is voiced. During the game, he gets companions, including a dog, which can be given different commands, such as fetching an item. In battles, the VATS system from the third part of the series is used: the fight can be paused and you can select the part of the enemy’s body that you want to hit or shoot at. In clashes, it is often possible to achieve victory by cunning: to shorten the path to the goal, to persuade to avoid the battle. In all cases, a high level of relevant skills is required. The development of the hero takes place according to the traditional SPECIAL system with the parameters of strength, feelings, endurance, charisma, intelligence, dexterity and luck. At each level of development of his character, the player receives one point, which is invested in an increase in any parameter, skills, including special skills and the possession of various types of weapons.",

He covers up the murder by claiming his father was poisoned and launches a security check. T-Bug is killed by Arasaki's in-house hackers. As Vee and Wells flee, a gunfight ensues; Jackie is mortally wounded, the biochip's protective case is critically damaged. Vee and Jackie leave the scene of the robbery, but on the way to safety, Wells bleeds to death and gives the chip to Vee, to hand it over to Dexter. V is forced to insert a biochip into his head to keep him functional. DeShawn is furious at the unwanted attention the police now have on him. He shoots V in the head and leaves him for dead in a junkyard, but DeShawn is subsequently killed by Goro Takemura, former head of security Saburo Arasaki. Goro helps the protagonist survive. Takemura wants to bring the patricide Yorinobu to clean water. After waking up, it turns out that the chip contained the identity of Johnny Silverhand, the famous rocker, anarchist and terrorist who died half a century ago after he destroyed the previous Arasaki headquarters with a nuclear explosion. V learns from his rapper Victor Vector that DeSean's bullet activated the resurrection biochip technology, but also triggered an irreversible process whereby Silverhand's memories and personality began to overwrite V's memories, replacing them with his own. Chip cannot be removed as it will result in V's instant death. The protagonist only has a few weeks left to live, so V starts looking for a way to get rid of Silverhand and still survive. While reliving Silverhand's memories, V learns that in 2023, his then-girlfriend, the brilliant hacker Alt (Alterra) Cunningham created the Soul Killer, an artificial intelligence capable of replicating people's minds through its neural connections. Arasaka kidnapped Cunningham and forced her to create a corporate-specific version of the Murderer that stored minds in Arasaki's digital fortress, Mikoshi.
