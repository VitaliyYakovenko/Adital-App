  "plot" : "The protagonist begins his journey as a prisoner, who is being taken to execution for illegally crossing the border of Skyrim. The sudden appearance of a dragon at the moment of execution allows an escape. Over the course of the story, the hero learns that the civil war in Skyrim is the last point in the sequence of events foretold in the prophecy of the Elder Scrolls, and that he is Dovahkiin, the Dragonborn, able to absorb the souls of defeated dragons and scream in their ancient language. With his subsequent actions, the hero saves Skyrim from Alduin, the Eater of Worlds. In the final battle of the Dragon War, when defeat seemed inevitable, Alduin was transported into the future with the help of the Elder Scroll by three Nordic warriors of antiquity. The protagonist will have to go through a number of different tasks to defeat him, the tyrant of the lands of Skyrim.",
  "details" : "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim retains the large and open world concept of The Elder Scrolls series. The player can freely roam throughout the province of Skyrim, which includes nine large cities, many small villages, as well as vast expanses of wild lands and high mountains. In cities, the player can indulge in activities such as cooking and potions, enchanting items, farming, working with ore, or blacksmithing. At the same time, the developers noted that a complete detailed study of the world could take about 500 hours.",
